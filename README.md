:heart_eyes_cat: omg go edition :heart_eyes_cat:

whatbot is a chat bot written in Go. Maybe.

The original whatbot was written purely as an exercise in futility, to try, desperately, to replace the functionality of infobot without driving us insane. It was written in "Modern Perl", that is, object oriented Perl with coding standards, using Moose and other extensions to make it not nearly as horrible as something like, well, infobot.
